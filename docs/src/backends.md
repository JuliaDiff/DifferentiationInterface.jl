# Backends

## Types

Most backend choices are defined by [ADTypes.jl](https://github.com/SciML/ADTypes.jl).

!!! warning
    Only the backends listed here are supported by DifferentiationInterface.jl, even though ADTypes.jl defines more.

```@docs
AutoChainRules
AutoDiffractor
AutoEnzyme
AutoForwardDiff
AutoForwardDiff()
AutoFiniteDiff
AutoPolyesterForwardDiff
AutoPolyesterForwardDiff()
AutoReverseDiff
AutoZygote
```

We also provide a few of our own:

```@docs
AutoFastDifferentiation
SecondOrder
```

## [Mutation support](@id backend_mutation_behavior)

All backends are compatible with allocating functions `f(x) = y`. Only some are compatible with mutating functions `f!(y, x) = nothing`:

| Backend                                 | Mutating functions |
| :-------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `AutoChainRules(ruleconfig)`            | ✗                  |
| `AutoDiffractor()`                      | ✗                  |
| `AutoEnzyme(Enzyme.Forward)`            | ✓                  |
| `AutoEnzyme(Enzyme.Reverse)`            | ✓                  |
| `AutoFiniteDiff()`                      | soon               |
| `AutoForwardDiff()`                     | ✓                  |
| `AutoPolyesterForwardDiff(; chunksize)` | ✓                  |
| `AutoReverseDiff()`                     | ✓                  |
| `AutoZygote()`                          | ✗                  |

## Second order

For second-order differentiation, you can either

- use a single backend  
- combine a pair of backends into a [`SecondOrder`](@ref) object

In Hessian computations, the most efficient combination is often forward-over-reverse, i.e. `SecondOrder(reverse_backend, forward_backend)`.

!!! danger
    Many backend combinations will fail for second order.
    Some because of our implementation, and some because the outer backend cannot differentiate through code generated by the inner backend.
    Be ready to experiment, or check our test suite to see which ones we have vetted.

## Package extensions

```@meta
CurrentModule = DifferentiationInterface
```

Backend-specific extension content is not part of the public API.

```@autodocs
Modules = [
    Base.get_extension(DifferentiationInterface, :DifferentiationInterfaceChainRulesCoreExt),
    Base.get_extension(DifferentiationInterface, :DifferentiationInterfaceDiffractorExt),
    Base.get_extension(DifferentiationInterface, :DifferentiationInterfaceEnzymeExt),
    Base.get_extension(DifferentiationInterface, :DifferentiationInterfaceFastDifferentiationExt),
    Base.get_extension(DifferentiationInterface, :DifferentiationInterfaceFiniteDiffExt),
    Base.get_extension(DifferentiationInterface, :DifferentiationInterfaceForwardDiffExt),
    Base.get_extension(DifferentiationInterface, :DifferentiationInterfacePolyesterForwardDiffExt),
    Base.get_extension(DifferentiationInterface, :DifferentiationInterfaceReverseDiffExt),
    Base.get_extension(DifferentiationInterface, :DifferentiationInterfaceZygoteExt)
]
Filter = t -> !(t <: ADTypes.AbstractADType)
```
