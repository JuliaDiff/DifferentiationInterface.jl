An interface to various automatic differentiation backends in Julia.

## Goal

This package provides a backend-agnostic syntax to differentiate functions `f(x) = y`, where `x` and `y` are either numbers or abstract arrays.

It started out as an experimental redesign for [AbstractDifferentiation.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/AbstractDifferentiation.jl).

## Example

```jldoctest
julia> using DifferentiationInterface, Enzyme

julia> backend = EnzymeReverseBackend();

julia> f(x) = sum(abs2, x);

julia> value_and_gradient(backend, f, [1., 2., 3.])
(14.0, [2.0, 4.0, 6.0])
```

## Design

Each backend must implement only one primitive:

- forward mode: the pushforward, computing a Jacobian-vector product
- reverse mode: the pullback, computing a vector-Jacobian product

From these primitives, several utilities are defined, depending on the type of the input and output:

|              | scalar output | array output    |
| ------------ | ------------- | --------------- |
| scalar input | derivative    | multiderivative |
| array input  | gradient      | jacobian        |

## Supported backends

Forward mode:

- [ForwardDiff.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ForwardDiff.jl)
- [Enzyme.jl](https://github.com/EnzymeAD/Enzyme.jl)
- [ChainRulesCore.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ChainRulesCore.jl)
- [FiniteDiff.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/FiniteDiff.jl)

Reverse mode:

- [ChainRulesCore.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ChainRulesCore.jl)
- [Zygote.jl](https://github.com/FluxML/Zygote.jl)
- [ReverseDiff.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ReverseDiff.jl)

Experimental:

- [PolyesterForwardDiff.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/PolyesterForwardDiff.jl)
- [Diffractor.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/Diffractor.jl) (currently broken due to [#277](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/Diffractor.jl/issues/277))
