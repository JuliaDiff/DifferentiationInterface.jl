# Overloads

DifferentiationInterface.jl provides a handful of [operators](@ref "Operators") like [`gradient`](@ref) or [`jacobian`](@ref), each with several variants:

- **out-of-place** or **in-place** behavior
- **with** or **without primal** output value
- support for **one-argument functions** `y = f(x)` or **two-argument functions** `f!(y, x)`

While it is possible to define every operator using just [`pushforward`](@ref) and [`pullback`](@ref), some backends have more efficient implementations of high-level operators.
When they are available, we **always** call these backend-specific overloads.

The following tables summarize all implemented overloads for each backend.
The cells can have three values:

- ❌: the operator is not overloaded because the backend does not support it
- ✅: the operator is overloaded
- NA: the operator does not exist

!!! tip
    Check marks (✅) are clickable and link to the source code.
