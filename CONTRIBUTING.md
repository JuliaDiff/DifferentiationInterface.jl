# Contributing

Thank you for wanting to contribute to [DifferentiationInterface.jl](https://github.com/gdalle/DifferentiationInterface.jl)!
If you have a potential improvement in mind, please [open an issue](https://github.com/gdalle/DifferentiationInterface.jl/issues/new/choose) first to discuss it with the maintainers.
Don't hesitate to ping said maintainers ([`@gdalle`](https://github.com/gdalle) and [`@adrhill`](https://github.com/adrhill)) if they don't answer within a week or so.
Once your issue receives positive feedback, you're welcome to open a draft pull request.
Draft pull requests have a lightened CI workflow, which only runs tests on the latest stable release of Julia (and not LTS or pre-release).

The repository follows the [ColPrac](https://github.com/SciML/ColPrac) best practices, and its code is formatted using [BlueStyle](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/BlueStyle).
Please refer to the [dev guide](https://gdalle.github.io/DifferentiationInterface.jl/DifferentiationInterface/stable/dev_guide/) for details on the package structure and the testing pipeline.
